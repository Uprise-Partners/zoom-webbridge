# zoom-webbridge

## Summary
This small web frontend is intended to allow for easier access to the Zoom web client for folks that are unable to use or install the zoom software client.

## Usage
Download and open ZoomWebBridge.html using any modern browser or see below how we packaged for distribution without hosting

## Testing
This has been tested on Safari 13.0.5, Chrome 80.0.3987.162, and Edge 80.0.361.103

## Packaging
Since this is a static page not requiring a backend, and relatively small, we were able to distribute links to it without hosting by using https://itty.bitty.site/

This generated url from itty.bitty is quite large, since it encodes the entire link in the url so we used https://tinyurl.com/ to shorten it for distribution.
